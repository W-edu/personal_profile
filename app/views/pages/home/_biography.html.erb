          From a young age I have had an affinity for design - from desinging and building the desk I am writing from as a teenager to designing the replacement LED lighting for The London Stadium and other large building projects. In recent years I became interested in software and automation of tasks which I came across during my everyday workflow and decided to retrain to become a web developer.

          Being involved with engineering projects in various forms for many years has given me an understanding of what it takes to make projects a reality from inception to delivery taking into account technological, logistical and human factors. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited to get started in the industry, being part of great solutions to taxing problems in the modern world.
